# acc

The so back meters are off the charts (we are so back). AlexC has a lot of problems and the codebase is kind of a mess so we're starting fresh with acc, which stands for AlexC Continued. This might be the greatest thing ever made or it might end up being a worse version of Go, only time will tell. I'll update the README once I make more progress.
